*This repository contains Python code for analyzing PlayStation video game sales data. We utilize various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.* 

## Introduction

The provided Jupyter Notebook, "Solutions.ipynb", showcases a series of data analysis tasks on PlayStation video game sales data. These tasks include data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, visualization, and insights generation.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Import Libraries**: Install required libraries and import necessary modules.

2. **Reading the Data**: Load the PlayStation video games dataset into the notebook.

3. **Displaying Data**: View the first 10 rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

4. **Descriptive Statistics**: Provide a summary of the dataset including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

5. **Showing Dataset Shape**: Display the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).

6. **Displaying Data Types**: List the data types of each column in the dataset.

7. **Extracting Release Year**: Extract the year from the 'Release date' column and create a new column named 'Release Year'.

8. **Identifying Top-Selling Games**: Identify and visualize the top-selling video games based on copies sold.

9. **Visualizing Genre Distribution**: Display the distribution of video game genres using a visualization.

10. **Identifying Top Developers**: Identify the developers with the highest total sales and list the top 5 developers.

11. **Filtering by Release Year**: Filter the dataset to include only games released after 2016 and calculate the standard deviation of copies sold for these games.

12. **Grouping by Genre**: Group the data by genre, calculate the average copies sold for each genre, and determine the genre with the highest average sales.

13. **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between copies sold and release year.



## Analysis Tasks

The notebook covers the following analysis tasks:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Descriptive statistics and data summary
- Visualization of top-selling games
- Distribution of video game genres
- Identifying top developers by total sales
- Filtering data for games released after 2016 and calculating standard deviation
- Grouping data by genre and determining the genre with the highest average sales
- Visualizing the relationship between copies sold and release year

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the PlayStation video games market, including top-selling games, genre distribution, developer performance, and sales trends over time.
